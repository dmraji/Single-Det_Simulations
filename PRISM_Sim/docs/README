Simluation of PRISM

- Detectors are CZT, world is vacuum

- Basic physics is included (Compton, Photoelectric, Pair Production, Rayleigh..)

- If photon hits detector and has photoabsorption reaction, we tally into ROOT histogram
  - ROOT histogram can then be read by python script in the analysis directory
  - another python script is used to perform the reconstruction

- can be run by running $ ./CodedAperture in the /Debug directory
  - macros exist that will run particles at every angle in -30,30 in theta and phi
    - see the response_loop* macros

- output will be in the form of a root file names totalresponse.root
