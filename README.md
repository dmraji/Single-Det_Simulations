# Imaging Simulations
Geant4 simulations for coded aperture and Compton imaging with PRISM, HEMI, and CCI2.

### PRISM
* Portable Radiation Imaging, Spectroscopy and Mapping
* Spherical arrangement of 1 cm<sup>3</sup> CZT-CPG detectors
* 196 total detector locations.
* Coded arrangement to facilitate coded aperture and Compton imaging in 4\pi
* Depth-of-interaction readouts

### HEMI
* High Efficiency Multi-modal Imager
* Planar arrangement of 1 cm<sup>3</sup> CZT-CPG detectors
* 64 available detector locations in front and back planes
* 50% coded configuration in front plane, fully populated back plane
* Coded aperture with limited FOV, Compton imaging in 4\pi

### CCI-2
* Compton Compton Imager version 2
* Double sided germanium strip detector
* Passive lead (or tungsten?) coded mask placed in front
* Coded aperture and Compton imager
