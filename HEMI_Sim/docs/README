Simple HEMI detector simulation to generate system response

- currently do not have any materials or physics
  - simply just vacuum/water and using geantinos
  - if track hits detector, the particle is killed
  - record the number of hits per detector into ROOT histogram
  - ROOT histogram can then be read by python script in the analysis directory
  - another python script is used to perform the reconstruction

- can be run by running $ ./CodedAperture in the /Debug directory
  - macros exist that will run particles at every angle in -30,30 in theta and phi
  - see the response_loop* macros

- output will be in the form of a root file names totalresponse.root
