Simple HEMI detector simulation to generate system response

- Detectors are CZT, world is vacuum
- Using optimized HEMI mask with fully popoulated backplane (not up to date)

- Basic physics is included (Compton, Photoelectric, Pair Production, Rayleigh..)

- If photon hits detector and has photoabsorption reaction, we tally into ROOT histogram
  - ROOT histogram can then be read by python script in the analysis directory
  - another python script is used to perform the reconstruction
					- from within the analysis directory run $ ipython
					- once in ipython, run $ run readsystemresponse.py
																												$ run reconstruction.py

- can be run by running $ ./CodedAperture in the /Debug directory
  - macros exist that will run particles at every angle in -30,30 in theta and phi
    - see the response_loop* macros

- output will be in the form of a root file names totalresponse.root



- to build with cmake use the following: $ cmake -DGeant4_DIR=/path/to/geant4-install/lib/Geant4-10.0.2/ .
			- then just use $ make -j4

- or if you want to use Xcode, use the "-G Xcode" flag
