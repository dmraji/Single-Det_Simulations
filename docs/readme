#------------------

Required software:
Geant4.10.2.p01
CMake 3.5+
healpy

#------------------

To compile:
- Replace user Geant4 directory and cmake executable in compile.sh
- run $sh compile

- my output is:

#------------------

- Single simulation can be executed with $./PRISM macros/run.mac

- System response simulation can be executed with $./PRISM macros/response/hp.mac

- See macro files for simulation options

- Outputs will be dumped to the output/ directory

#------------------

- Macro description:

RunAng.mac -> records data for one isotope energy on a track in multiple outputs,
		then moves onto the next track angle. Can be configured to loop
		through multiple isotope energies.

PointBeams.mac -> records data for one isotope energy in one output, with the beam
			cycling through a number of points around the detector.
